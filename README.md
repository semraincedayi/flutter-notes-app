# Notes App (Flutter)

This project is an attempt to develop a notes app using Flutter. My goal is to create a simple application where users can quickly and easily take notes, edit them, and delete them. The project is currently incomplete and is in the development phase.

## Development Status
At the moment, I am working on the basic features for adding and listing notes. I plan to implement other functions (such as editing, deleting, and data storage) in future stages.
